## Hello World, my name is Amanda Esquivel

#I am a front-end developer who also specializes in UX/UI design. I have always been a person who leans towards my creative side and also loves technology so I managed to find a great middle ground in the area I have managed to set myself professionally. 

👩‍💻 I am currently working on furthering my skills on React.js.

You can find me on 🗃 [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xmanda/)  

There's no time for impostor syndrome.
